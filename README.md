# PlantUML Online Editor

I'm sick and tired from the plantuml.com site. 
Here is a brand new ;-) online editor based on ACE Editor.
Featrues:

 * Syntax hightlight (still Javascript based)
 * Live Preview
 
 
 
### Used libraries

 * [plantuml](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml) as an Engine + Online processor
 * [ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/) for the awesome syntax-highlighted editor
